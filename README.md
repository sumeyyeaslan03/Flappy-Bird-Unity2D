# Flappy-Bird-Unity2D

For the flappy bird game I developed in Unity, I added a hidden button to the "Get Started" picture on the main screen.
There is a hidden button in the tap, which is manually marked to get started.
If you wish, you can make a small change in the code and start the game by tapping anywhere on the screen.
